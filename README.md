# Rainmeter Quote Skin Generator

A lightweight web-based tool and Rainmeter skin that displays a **random motivational quote** on your Windows desktop.

The skin supports:
- Random quote on every skin refresh or system boot
- Automatic daily quote rotation
- Custom fonts, colours, and text alignment
- A visual quote editor that exports a ready-to-use `quotes.lua`

Built for simplicity, reliability, and zero external dependencies inside Rainmeter.

## How the Quote Logic Works

- **On refresh or load**
  - A new random quote is selected (if enabled).
- **Daily rotation**
  - At midnight, the skin switches to a new daily base quote.
- **Persistence**
  - State is saved so quotes are not repeated until all have been shown.

The logic is handled entirely in Lua and does not rely on external services.

## Customisation

You can control behaviour via Rainmeter variables, including:
- Quote position
- Width and alignment
- Refresh behaviour
- Fonts and colours

Each quote entry supports:
- Text
- Author
- Font
- Colour (RGB)
- Quote alignment
- Author alignment

---

## Development Notes

- No frameworks required
- Uses plain JavaScript, HTML, and Lua
- Lua logic is intentionally defensive to avoid Rainmeter crashes
- Generator output is deterministic and Rainmeter-safe
